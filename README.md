## What is Earth Day Canada?
> In 1990, the creation of the organization in France and in Canada goes hand in hand with the internationalization of the Earth Day movement. In Quebec, since 1995, Earth Day has been celebrated by organizing all kinds of awareness-raising activities on environmental issues. In 2015, the French and Quebec teams joined forces to breathe new life into the Earth Day movement in France, Quebec, and the rest of the French-speaking world. In 2019, a strategic alliance was formed with EcoKids in Canada to enable the environmental programs carried out in Quebec by Earth Day to grow nationally. 



> Earth Day Canada's mission is to help people and organizations reduce their environmental impact in addition to unite people around the annual April 22nd Earth Day event. 

> Technical challenge: Earth Day Canada is looking to create a web-based platform that will help farmers share information about gleaning opportunities, connect volunteers to events, and notify nonprofits when the produce is available.
